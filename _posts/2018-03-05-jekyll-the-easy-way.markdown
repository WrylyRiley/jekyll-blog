I had to come up with a project idea for the General Assembly showcase, and I was stumped...

![jekyll]({{page.img}})


#### Backstory

I had previously spent a significant amount of time writing an [incomplete react frontend](https://github.com/zbauer91/habitrack-react) and an [incomplete rails api](https://github.com/zbauer91/habitrack) for this lofty app idea I've been mulling around the last few months: HabiTrack. It wasn't a bad idea, it was just woefully out of my grasp. My first attempt was during project two, and this time around, I was unprepared in ways I could not have seen coming. I'll leave the meat of the story to [this post.](#)

#### So what then?...
I wanted to do something complete, ambitious (sort of), and interesting enough to talk to potential employers about. It hit me like a ton of feathers: A blog!

#### How?

I couldn't just show them my twitter, right?....right?

I had known about Jekyll for some time now and decided to give it a go and see if I could make a functioning blog!

#### Decisions:

* bootstrap <-- link to separate blogpost on learning bootstrap 4
* minima <-- lack thereof
* linking it to my portfolio website?
