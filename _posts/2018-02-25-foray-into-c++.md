Today I learned [elixir!](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir)

### Backstory

A few days ago I received a call from a recruiter looking to fill a position for a junior web developer that knew a little bit of Elixir, Elm, and Phoenix. They were willing to put all candidates through a 2.5 hour training course on Udemy to get them up to speed if they didn't already know some.

I obliged, and off I went to learn my first truly functional language

### First Impressions
* tail-optimized recursion
* zero state modification

### Takeaway
* FP is fun and super useful for when you absolutely cannot have side effects

### Continuing education
blah blah blah continue to learn more about it and elm and phoenix.
