Here I'll talk about some of the things I've been doing to keep myself busy, and what I'll be doing moving forward.

### Post-Graduation

This is where shit gets real...seriously. 

I'm now being faced with decisions about how I want my career to go. I've never really been in the driver's seat before. Sure, I went to college and got an education, but back then I wasn't a strong candidate at any of the places I applied to. I held exactly none of the cards, and it showed. Now, things are different. I command a quality education and have a portfolio to back up claim I make of learning new languages and techniques and can leverage my prior experience to show that I am, indeed, a quality candidate. 

This is a new situation for me, and I have to be careful how I proceed. I can let my bootcamp experience propel me forward or hold me back.

### Continuing Education

As evidenced by some of the blog posts I've released so far, I haven't been sitting idly waiting for the perfect job to come around. I've been working to improve my skills in existing areas and show that I can learn new concepts in new areas.

Between this blog, learning C++ and Elixir, and continuing to get better at JavaScript, I'm preparing myself well for an exciting future.

### The Job Search

I was told at GA that I should be putting 90% of my time post-graduation into job searching, but I'm not so certain that's true. I'm planning on splitting it evenly, so I can continue to gain valuable skills and apply to harder and harder jobs. They say I can make between $60k and $80k for my first job. I'm going to see to it that $80k is something I can command.
